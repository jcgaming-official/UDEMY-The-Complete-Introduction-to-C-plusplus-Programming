/*for loop is a control flow statement that will iterate part of program several times


    for int (int i  = 0; i < 3; i++){
    cout << i << ;
    }

it is divided into 3 parts. int i = 0; basically means it runs before execution

i < 3;  is a condition

I++ is a code to grow the value

while loop is a control flow statement that will run on certain boolean conditions
